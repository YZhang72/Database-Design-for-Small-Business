# Database-Design-for-Small-Business: This is the group project of Team Voltaire for MIS686 at SDSU. 
The MIS 686 Consortium proposes to reduce the average work order completion time, 
increase customers satisfaction, retention rate, and market share by cutting procurement lead time 
in parts and electronic components with implementation of a database designed to support both operations 
and customer interactions.
